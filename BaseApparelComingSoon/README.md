## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## Challenges:

-  Validating email and showing error to user
-  Somehow during development, there was horizontal overflow scroll but it went away after playing with a bunch of the code

## What I learned:

-  Show error/success message to user after pressing a button
-  Style an input form nicely
-  Working with large responsive images

## Time to Complete: ~ 2.5 hours
