## The challenge

My challenge is to build out whatever is given and get it looking as close to the design as possible. I can use any tools you like to help me complete the challenge. I am starting from the free newbie difficulty challenges and work my way up!

In each of the READMEs in each folders, I included the challenges I faced, what I learned, and the time it took to complete the challenge. It's a cool way to document my progress and work!
